    <h1>Hillary the Hiker</h1>

    <h2>Thinks</h2>
    <p>
      Hillary thinks her chances of completing a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail would increase if she knew how many miles to hike each day. She thinks doing
      a simple total mileage divided by days calculation doesn't take into account weather, terrain, and her health. For example, if she starts off too slow,
      she won't finish in time. If she starts off too fast, she may get injured and suffer prolonged downtime.
    </p>

    <h2>Sees</h2>
    <p>
      Hillary has seen other thru-hikers complete a thru-hike and she has seen others fail. The most common reasons for failing are running out of money and
      getting too severely injured. People often run out of money if their hike takes too long. And, people often get injured if they push themselves too hard.
    </p>

    <h2>Feels</h2>
    <p>
      Hillary feels her chances of success would increase if she was confident of the mileage per day per section was accurate. She does not feel good about her
      chances if she has to guess at her progress. She often asks herself - "am I going too slow? too fast?" Having confidence in a projection would boost her
      morale and increase her chances of success.
    </p>
    <h2>Does</h2>
    <p>
      Hillary often does shorter, section hikes of the AT and other trails. She has learned that it takes around 5 days for the aches and pains to level out and
      around 10 days for her to reach peak efficiency. She has learned that for each 1% increase in daily up/down elevation change, that shortens the distance
      by a similar amount. When the weather is wet and the trail is wet, her mileage per day is decreased by 20%. When the weather is below freezing, it
      requires an additional 1 hour per day preparing (e.g. heating food, putting on more layers) and that's 1 hour less hiking.
